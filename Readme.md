# Readme
This [keyboard] is inspired by Forager, Apiaster and Bad-Temper. It is a 50 key split ergonomic keyboard with a 2 thumb cluster, and a number row without the pinky keys. It uses the stagger and splay of bad-temper. 

Huntsman is named after the Australian spider, which inspired and the Matt Riley Characterâ€™s call-sign.

This is my first foray into keyboard design and follow my use of the [silakka54](https://github.com/Squalius-cephalus/silakka54/tree/main/firmware) which made me realise that there are certain features that I want in a keyboard. These include a more extended thumb cluster and exaggerated pinky stagger. whilst I have found the wired keyboard less restrictive, than I expected, I want to try a wireless build with screens.
